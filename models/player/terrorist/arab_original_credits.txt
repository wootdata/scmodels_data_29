Unnamed. He's just a replacement for that stinky CS ARAB model. Got a good name? Email me suggestions...

Notes: 

Mrrogers - Ok, this model has taken 2 weeks longer than it should have...finally after all the sweat, tears, and screams of frustration, he can be released to the public. There are lots of little problems that I have with the model. I had to reshape the mesh to match the crappy default skeletons in CS...that was a PAIN in my ass...since the only program I could do it with was Milkshape. I'm a max user...I'm a character studio user...learning Milkshape's little quirks was a bitch. His shoulders are screwed all to hell in alot of the animations...that'll be an area that I'll have to pay special attention to in my next release. Overall I'm quite satisfied with how he turned out, moreso with the skin than the actual model. Thanks Frosty!
