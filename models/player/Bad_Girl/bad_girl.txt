I used the Dawn model by Steve Gehrke. My girl has black hair and wears black gloves & boot, tattoos, piercings and nothing else!
I wanted a nude female that looked cool.  Unfortunately the Gina model is too bulky.  Luckily I found the very nice Dawn model.
She is my first skin attempt.  Right now I'm practicing with modelling and hopefully will have an original model soon.
If you are playing Half-Life on the Internet and see someone with the name "Bad_Girl", that's me using this model.

Thank you for taking the time to look at this skin!
