Installation:

   Just unzip straight into your Sierra/Half-life directory. The necessary folders will be created in the proper place. If for some reason it doesn't quite work like that then create 2 folders in your Half-life/valve/models/player directory named Skrag and SkragTC. Then put the appropriate files in the appropriate folders.

Thank you to the following:

   Big, big thanks go out to Bamphalas for helping me out with the team color skin. He layed out the palette so that it would be team color compatible and I then picked out the colors.
   Harlequin for getting me to repaint the iris. It looks soo much better than the original.
   To Cold Fusion and Polycount for being 2 great sites and letting me preview and post my models.
   Mete Cirigan for creating the program that made this possible for me
   Anybody who's made any tutorials on modelling or skinning. I checked out as many as I could find and learned a hell of a lot.
   And finally to everybody who gave some great feedback and let me know how much they liked the model just from screenshots. I hope this doesn't let you guys down.

Model Stats:

   676 triangles, nice and low poly for high speed performance :)
   411 vertices
   1 256x256 and 1 128x128 texture

Tools:

   Milkshape3D 1.3.2 and 1.4.0 (the new version got released during the construction of this model)
   Photoshop 5.5

About the model:

  Well it's not perfect but I minimized anything that was causing problems. There are quite few lite seams in the skin, most notably on the outside of the legs but it's nothing really bad. It took me longer than I expected to finish this model. The mesh took about 3 days overall to complete, the skin 2 weeks, and the animations around a week and a half. It would've taken much, much less time but kids, wife, work, stuff always seemed to set me back longer. The skin took so long cause I was learning and developing some techniques new to me. But I think it was worth it. It's definitely the best looking thing I've ever painted in Photoshop. I did all the animations myself. Nothing taken from Valve or anywhere else. I did reuse a lot of animations for different weapons. So I didn't make specific animations for each one. But in the end it doesn't really make a difference (at least I hope so). Hell, if you notice all the Valve weapon anims are basicly the same thing.
   
Some animations to check out:

   On a few of his death animations the eyeball rolls away from the body. I think it looks cool :)
   On the ref_aim_squeak he takes bites out of the snark and chews it up. That's something really cool to see in-game.

One last note:

   If you have the game, look for the Quake3 version coming soon! It's gonna have some cool effects not possible in Half-life and some extra skins.
