This is a converted and customized model I made for myself, probably
the model that i've been wanting to make since I started playing HL.

The mods are pretty extensive since I had to import all the regular
player animations and update the bones.  All in all it came out
pretty awesome.

All of the graphics work was done using Microsoft Imager2,
Wally, Photostyler, mgi Photosuite, and any other tool that
let me do what I needed.

All the compiling and decompiling and other bone related work
was done in Milkshape 1.5.10.

All the texture application was done directly in the very
nice Half-Life Model Viewer V1.24 by Mete Ciragan.

The total modification took about 3 days from start to
finish (a few hours total time).

Info:

Files included:
islave_baby.mdl - The HLDM player version of the game islave_baby model file
islave_baby.bmp - The picture you see when selecting the model in the game
islave_baby.txt - This text file

Place islave_baby.mdl, islave_baby.bmp, islave_baby.jpg and islave_baby.txt in a
new folder called islave_baby, in valve\models\player folder in your Half
Life directory.

** IMPORTANT NOTICE **

(thanks to NSi for the notice).
