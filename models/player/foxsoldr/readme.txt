Anthropomorphic Fox Player Model Set (Version 1)

Original Kain-9 Modeled by White Dragon (wdragon@goldcom.com)
New Skins/Tweeks by Green Muse (greenmuse@hotmail.com)


Greenmuse Addendums:

These are basically re-skinned Kain-9 models with a few modelling tweeks giving the original
Lupine anthropomorph a distinctly vulpine flavor. There are shortcomings for fox purists but 
they aren't very severe. Other than the fox markings, I added a few details missing in the original Kain-9, such as the interior of the mouth (roof and tongue) and some lines to deliniate toes. Details specific to each are as follows:

FoxNoble: Vulpine dressed in an opulent red vest, white laced shirt, and green crushed velvet pants -- very fancy renaissance look. Has a 'fox-tail' pony-tail. Cheekruffs are lower on this model. Seems to be the best liked by the beta-testers and looks great with the crossbow.

FoxPrvtr: Vulpine dressed in a green military coat, leather cover-breeches, and grey knickers, sort of remeniscent of a pirate ship captain. Has a blacktipped ponytail. Has moderate full cheekruffs. Someone nicknamed him Basil Brush.

FoxSoldr: Vulpine dressed in a grey and gild coat and metal-shod breeches. Definately looks like the fancy dress uniform of a futuristic military. Has a black-red-white streaked ponytail. Cheekruffs are higher on this model. This is "Omega", my personal model, but if no one else has it, how are they supposed to see it?

The original base fox model (not included) took about a day, and each of the clothed models took about 4 hours each. I decided to just do unique clothing styles instead of doing team colors (which White Dragon wasn't kidding about how difficult it can be). Special thanks to White Dragon for recompiling the changes on the models and correcting some animation bugs.

Bugs: Some mysterious discolorations here and there -- find them yourself. I didn't have the original guides to work with, so there's bound to be a few odds and ends. Also, there are no team colors -- that's sort of why I decided to do three separate similar models.

Install: Put the three directories in the valve/models/players folder.  

Go now, my uplifted vulpine brother and seek revenge upon the fox-hunters! ;>


Original Notes from White Dragon:

Face Count: 749

Kain-9 is a Lupine anthropomorphic, Not much of a story-line as to why :)
Guess I just wanted to prove a point on what could be done with HL models :)

As for the Tech side of this he's got an extra 7 bones to animate the tail properly
it was rather intereseting figuring out how to do it.  One of my next project is going
to involve a bit more :) And should have better animations than this one.  

If anyone wants to do skins, and if your good at it please e-mail me :) I'm not great
at doing skins, and would like a skinner who could help me with team colors <which isn't in this either>
